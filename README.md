# ONGC Network Automation & Domain Reputation Check System

This repository contains an **enterprise-grade network automation and domain reputation analysis system** developed as part of an **internship project at Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)**.  
The system automates **server traffic monitoring, domain reputation verification, and security assessment** to enhance network reliability and cybersecurity posture.

---

## Overview

Modern enterprise networks require continuous monitoring and proactive threat detection.  
This project focuses on **automating network inspection workflows** and performing **domain reputation checks** to identify potentially malicious or risky domains accessed within the organization’s network.

The solution is designed to be **scalable, modular, and adaptable** to large enterprise infrastructures such as ONGC.

## Key Features

- Automated network traffic monitoring
- Domain reputation analysis for accessed URLs
- Detection of suspicious or malicious domains
- Modular Python-based automation scripts
- Structured output for security analysis
- Designed for enterprise and PSU environments
